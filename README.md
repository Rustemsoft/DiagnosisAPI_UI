# DiagnosisAPI_UI
MVC web application to use Diagnosis API

SmrtX provides an API (Application Programming Interface) for patient preliminary medical diagnosis that can help you implement an intelligent 
symptom checker and Lab Test analyzer for your healthcare medical application.
When you incorporate Diagnosis API within your healthcare web-application it will have the same functionalities like presented in
DDxHub Diagnosis System (https://ddxhub.azurewebsites.net/). This is an alive example of implementation. By testing the DDxHub Diagnosis System you can see how global companies, 
as well as startups, have used it to enhance their business and support surrounding their patients and healthcare organizations.

When you transmit to our web service a basic patient health data (such as Blood test results and symptoms), our AI inference engine will analyze 
the data and provide you with a list of the most likely health conditions. We get this according to the complex statistical algorithms we use to 
make medical diagnosis.
